# FlightAware
An interactive application built using R, that provides a one stop platform for users to check alternative transport facilities in US and check the delays in flight

Features Include:
1. Interactive dashboard with ploty charts and heatmaps that shows the historic delay in flights. Users can choose the airport and the metrics they want to choose to customise the chart. 
2. A google map dashboard that asks users to give their destination and current location, based on which the system will recommend alternative transports to use apart from domestic flights. 
3. A real time sentiment analysis on tweets retrieved from Twitter about the airports and the destination the user will be travelling to.
